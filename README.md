# LunarUtility
Made this plugin because most LunarClientAPI plugins are all using lunar's old/non-official API.
This is also for devs who don't know how to use lunar's api so feel free using this.
Am still learning java and this is my first open sourced project.
Note: If you wanna use this for your server and don't know how to change stuff, shoot me a DM on discord @Dubai#1454 and I'll help you for free.

I'll probably be updating this more after my exams and add features like staff mods, nametags (with papi support), etc.

# Dependancies
This plugin requires Lunar's Official API [BukkitAPI](https://github.com/LunarClient/BukkitAPI/releases/tag/v1.0.1) or else it wont work!

1.7 or 1.8 spigot (I only tested it on 1.8 so if it doesn't work on 1.7 DM me to update this)

# Compile
To compile you need all the dependancies listed the pom.xml.

You MUST use this [BukkitAPI](https://github.com/LunarClient/BukkitAPI/releases/tag/v1.0.1) lib for the lunar API or else it wont work!
